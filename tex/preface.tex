\prefacesection{Abstract}
This report outlines the creation of a development tool for visualizing Ruby
dependencies. The goal of this project is to create a development tool that provides 
an easy way to visualize violations of certain design patterns in a call graph. The 
tool is designed for use by developers of Ruby on Rails web applications. The completed 
tool is able to output such a graph, but is limited to highlighting violations regarding 
only the use of service objects.
