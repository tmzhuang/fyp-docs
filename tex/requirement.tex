Use Case Descriptions
Name: DisplayGraph
Description: The system displays a call graph using a DOT file of target application and the GraphGenerator.
Precondition: A valid DOT file of the target application exists.
Primary actor: Developer
Secondary actors: GraphGenerator
Basic Flow:
The system prompts the developer for the location of the DOT file from the developer.
The system obtains the DOT file location and VALIDATES that the location is valid.
The system invokes the graphing function of the GraphGenerator using the DOT file.
Postcondition: The graphical representation of the DOT file is displayed to the developer.
Specific Alternative Flow: BFS 2
The system determines that the location entered is not a valid file location.
RESUME STEP BFS 1.
Postcondition: None.

Name: GenerateDOT
Description: The system generates a call graph of a target rails application
Precondition: The location of the target rails application is provided, or a valid DOT file of the call graph is provided
Primary actor: Developer
Secondary actors: None
Basic Flow:
The developer requests the system to generate a DOT file.
The system prompts the developer to determine the root folder of the target rails application.
The system VALIDATES that the target application at the specified location is a valid rails application.
INCLUDE USE CASE GenerateCallTrace.
INCLUDE USE CASE ParseCallTrace.
The system generates a DOT file using the parsed call trace.
Postcondition: A DOT file describing the call graph for the target rails application is produced.
Specific Alternative Flow: BFS 3
The system determines the target application is not a valid rails application.
The system notifies the developer the target application is not valid.
ABORT.
Postcondition: No DOT file is produced. The system is idle.

Name: GenerateCallTrace
Description: The system generates a call trace of the target rails application.
Precondition: The location of the root directory of a valid rails application is provided.
Primary actor: Developer
Secondary actors: RailsApplicationRunner
Basic Flow:
The system initiates the RailsApplicationRunner to run the target application.
The system logs the the RailsApplicationRunnerâ€™s calls and produces a call trace.
Postcondition: The call trace of the target rails application is produced.


Name: ParseCallTrace
Description: The call trace file produced by GenerateCallTrace is parsed.
Precondition: A valid call trace of the target application exists.
Primary actor: Developer
Secondary actors: None
Basic Flow: 
The system parses the call trace of the target rails application to produce a list of calls relevant to the call graph.
Postcondition: A list of calls relevant to the call graph is produced.
