For organizations who want to employ service objects in their Rails objects, it be can difficult to detect when the service objects are being circumvented. The proposed solution was develop a tool to visualize such violations, which was achieved by the end of the project.

The solution reached is rather niche; however the tool can be modified in the future to include other forms of violations the user wishes to detect. In such a case, the tool should also produce interactive output (as opposed to a static graph). In this way, the user can show or hide different types of violations in the target application.
