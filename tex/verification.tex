\chapter{Verification and Validation}
\label{chap:verification}

Verification of the system was achieved with a combination of unit tests and manual tests. Simple class behaviour that could be unit-tested, were tested this way. Several testing frameworks were used to assist in this endeavour. The unit-testing framework used is Minitest, which is included by default with Ruby. In addition Mocha was used for stubbing, and Guard for continuous testing. For more complex behaviour, such as verifying the output of a graph, it was simplest to manually verify.
